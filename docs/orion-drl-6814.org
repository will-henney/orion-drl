* The Deep Red Line \lambda6814 in the Orion Nebula

- Use MUSE and Keck HIRES data that I have lying around
- Plus whatever else I come across


** What sort of line is it?
- Is it really a Deep Red Line, given that we do not see it in NGC 346 or any of the other regions
- Is the spatial distribution really so unique?
  - I thought it looked quite like the Raman map, but I have not done a quantitative comparison yet
  - Now I am worrying that it might look more like a Fe II line
  - Also should compare with the Ca I] lines
    - Although if it ended up looking like the Ca I] lines, would that  really be so bad? They could be considered honorary DRLs anyway
